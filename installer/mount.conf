# Btrfs subvolumes to create if root filesystem is on btrfs volume.
# If *mountpoint* is mounted already to another partition, it is ignored.
# Separate subvolume for swapfile is handled separately and automatically.
#
# It is possible to prevent subvolume creation -- this is likely only relevant
# for the root (/) subvolume -- by giving an empty string as a subvolume
# name. In this case no subvolume will be created. When using snapper as
# a rollback mechanism, it is recommended to **not** create a subvolume
# for root.
