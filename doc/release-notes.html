<h1>OpenMandriva Lx 4.3 Release Notes</h1>
<p>The OpenMandriva Lx teams are pleased to announce the availability of
<strong>OpenMandriva Lx 4.3</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Available Media</strong></p>
<p>This release is available as a live media USB flash drive (memory stick), downloadable in ISO format. These are available on our
downloads page. USB flash drive installation is usually noticeably faster. As always speed depends on many factors. Live media means you
are able to run OpenMandriva Lx straight from a memory stick (see below) and try it before installing it. You may also install the system
to hard disk either from the running live image or from the boot manager.</p>
<p>Available ISO files are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>x86_64 KDE Plasma desktop full featured (includes the most common
used functionalities, multimedia and office software)</p></li>
<li><p>znver1 KDE Plasma desktop: we have also built a version
specifically for current AMD processors (Ryzen, ThreadRipper, EPYC) that
outperforms the generic (x86_64) version by taking advantage of new
features in those processors. znver1 is for the listed processors
(Ryzen, ThreadRipper, EPYC) only, do not install on any other
hardware.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Installable images are offered for the Pinebook Pro, Raspberry Pi 4B, Raspberry Pi 3B+, Synquacer, Cubox Pulse and generic UEFI compatible
devices (such as most aarch64 server boards)</p>
<p><strong>System requirements</strong></p>
<p>OpenMandriva Lx 4.3 requires at least 2048 MB of memory and at least 10 GB of hard drive space (see below for known issues with
partitioning).</p>
<p><em>Important Note: Graphics Hardware:</em></p>
<p>The KDE Plasma Desktop requires a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL 2.0 or above. We recommend using AMD, Intel, Adreno or VC4
graphics chips.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Connection</strong></p>
<p>Calamares Installer checks if an Internet connection is available, but OpenMandriva Lx will install just fine even without. It is perfectly
OK to simply install as you normally would and proceed to use your new system as normal. Updating such a system would require being temporarily
connected to the internet or downloading the packages elsewhere and transferring them to the installed system and installing the updated
packages. But as you are not connected to the internet you could simply use the system and not update for how ever long you see fit.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Machines</strong></p>
<p>At this time the only virtualization software that OMLx ISOs are tested on is VirtualBox. The same hardware requirements apply when
running in virtual machines. For VirtualBox you must always have at least 2048 MB of memory or OpenMandriva Lx will fail to boot. Also for
VirtualBox it is advisable to install to a fresh virtual machine, as trying to install to an existing one may occasionally fail.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Calamares installer</strong></p>
<p>Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable, in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases.
It aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and distribution-agnostic. Calamares includes an advanced partitioning
feature, with support for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated “Replace
Partition” option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Many Linux distros use Calamares
installer and each has its own implementation and standards. The user may notice some small differences but it does not mean this is a
bug.</p>
<p><strong>Partitioning</strong></p>
<p>At this time partitioning LVM and Raid setups with Calamares installer are not supported.</p>
<p>The following applies to all partitioning of all installations on hardware: If you have a UEFI/EFI computer and your BIOS offers a choice
when you boot installation media between for example:</p>
<p><code>USB some Flash Drive</code></p>
<p><code>UEFI USB some Flash Drive</code></p>
<p>You have to choose the UEFI option and boot that. But know also that not all computers will do this. Some with more spartan FIRMWARE or BIOS
will offer only the one option and almost always it is the correct one.
So for instance if on a notebook you don't see the above choice no worries. <em>If you have multiple storage drives enabled they all need
to have the same partition table type.</em> They either need to all be GPT or all MBR for everything to work properly. On UEFI computers in
multi-boot situation with multiple storage drives if you already have an existing <code>/boot/efi</code> partition you should use that. The
partitioner will not create another <code>/boot/efi</code> with proper flags and installation will result in error with no bootloader
installed. Do not format you just set the mount point to
<code>/boot/efi</code> and select the <code>boot</code> flag. One can have many different boot loaders for different operating systems in the
same <code>/boot/efi</code> partition. If there is any need to switch boot loaders that is done in FIRMWARE or BIOS settings.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrading OMLx 4.2 system to OMLx 4.3</strong></p>
<p>See <a
href="https://forum.openmandriva.org/t/upgrading-omlx-4-2-system-to-omlx-4-3/4338">Upgrading
OM Lx 4.2 system to OM Lx 4.3</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>File system type</strong></p>
<p>In the Calamares installer for OM Lx (all branches) the file system list includes all file systems the operating system recognizes for a
host of reasons. This does not mean one should use anything in the list for your root ( <code>/</code> ) partition. <code>ext4</code> is the
official recommendation for root, fat32 is the recommendation for <code>boot/efi</code>. <code>xfs</code> is also known to work for root
partition. <code>f2fs</code> <em>should</em> work for root partition if the user is using a flash storage device (ssd).
<strong><em>Example</em></strong>: It is expected that users installing an OM Lx operating system to realize that you would not choose fat16 or
fat32 for your root partition. Conversely you would not use ext4 for a <code>/boot/efi</code> partition.</p>
<p>No official recommendation is made at this time for storage partitions or for a seperate <code>/home</code> partition. It is
expected the users using seperate storage partitions or a seperate <code>/home</code> partition know what they are doing. For
<code>/home</code> the easy way is to use whatever you use for your root partition.</p>
<p><strong>NVME SSDs</strong></p>
<p>Some NVME SSDs may not be recognized by OMLx 4.3 Live ISO. The Live ISO has 2 different workarounds for this under "Troubleshooting" in the
Grub2 Menu. They are (PCIE ASPM=OFF) and (NVME APST=OFF). We hope this works for most peoples hardware. Problem is known and being worked on by
OpenMandriva developers and upstream developers. See more in Errata/NVME SSDs. Hardware recognition for nvme SSDs is considerably improved for OM
Lx 4.3. This issue is of course very hardware specific.</p>
<p><strong>Installer and EFI Support</strong></p>
<p>This release of OpenMandriva Lx supports booting and installation with and without UEFI.</p>
<p><em>Note that secure boot is NOT supported.</em> <em>Note it is NOT recommended to mix MBR and GPT partitions.</em></p>
<p>If you wish to perform an EFI installation on an existing MBR disk it will be necessary to convert the disk partition table to the newer GPT
partitioning scheme. To do this you need to use the gdisk tool. A typical invocation would be gdisk /dev/sda: the existing partition table
will be converted in memory to the GPT scheme. Warnings will be issued about potential data loss, the disk will not be altered until you write
the partition table by pressing w. You are advised to back up any important data.</p>
<p>There may be occasions where the conversion cannot be performed, this will usually be due to insufficient space at the beginning or end of the
disk to write the partition table. It may be necessary to delete or resize a partition to create the needed space, gparted is your friend in
these circumstances.
</p>
<p>
There is still a need to create a <code>/boot/efi</code> partition to contain the boot equipment and this must be created while running the
Calamares installer. When the installer reaches the partitioning stage the <code>/</code> (root) partition should be removed and a small (300
MB) fat32 partition created at the start of the drive. The partition must be named <code>/boot/efi</code> and the <code>boot</code> flag set.
If diskspace is critical then a smaller partition may be used, but be sure to set it as fat32 in Calamares otherwise the installation will
fail. If you fail to observe these steps the installation of the boot loader will fail. Subsequently partition the disk in the normal way.</p>
<p>Please share your experiences on the forums so that we may improve this aspect of the installation.</p>
<p>If you are installing beside Windows 8, 8.1, 10 or similar EFI booted OS as a precaution please ensure that you have recovery disks and you
have backed up any important data. Our testing has been limited with this configuration, but successful installations have been performed
with no issues. We would welcome any feedback in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Changing Partition Type</strong></p>
<p>Please note that Calamares cannot convert one partition type to another and preserve partition data. If you run Calamares from the live
image it is not possible to change an existing partition type. Trying to do this generates an error message. In order to do this you must first
delete the partition and recreate it as the type that you wish.</p>
<p><strong>Booting from USB</strong>
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to boot this release from an USB storage device. To transfer the live/installation image you may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use rosa-imagewriter available from our repos:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>sudo dnf --refresh install rosa-imagewriter</code></p>
<p>Or, if you do not have OpenMandriva Lx yet, you can get rosa-imagewriter download links at <a href="http://wiki.rosalab.ru/en/index.php/ROSA_ImageWriter">this
page</a>. At least 4 GB of flash drive capacity is recommended.
Persistent storage is not necessary. Note that this will erase everything on your USB!</p>
<p>Please do not use other usb-writing tools as some Windows tools (e.g.
Rufus) truncate the volume name. This breaks the boot process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Via dd You may alternatively dd the image to your USB stick:</li>
</ul>
<p>$ sudo dd if=<iso_name> of=<usb_drive> bs=4M</p>
<p>Replace <iso_name> with the path to the ISO and <usb_drive> with the
device node of the USB drive, i.e. /dev/sdb.</p>
<ul>
<li>SUSE Studio ImageWriter has also been tested and works for burning ISO images to USB storage device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Booting from DVD</strong></p>
<p>Booting from DVD is deprecated. For OM Lx 4.3 ISOs there are
workarounds in <a href="https://forum.openmandriva.org/t/booting-om-lx-4-3-iso-from-dvd/4377">Booting
OM Lx 4.3 ISO from DVD</a> that should enable one to boot from DVD.</p>
<p><strong>About Repositories</strong></p>
<p>We now have the om-repo-picker aka Software Repository Selector to select additional repositories for more package availability. <strong>Do
not mix the repositories from different release versions/update channels</strong>. This means, as an example, do not use Cooker
repositories on a Rock system. If you use Rock, use Rock repositories only.
This is explained in more detail in <a href="https://wiki.openmandriva.org/en/policies/release-plan-and-repositories">OpenMandriva
Release Plan and Repositories</a>. If you mix different release/update channel repositories and you break your computer the solution is to do a
fresh install. After that fresh install do not do this again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How to install and remove packages</strong></p>
<p>While graphical tools (Discover, dnfdragora, etc.) are useful to find out available extra software, we strongly suggest to install packages
from command line:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo dnf --refresh install &lt;package_name&gt;</code></p>
<p>To remove a package:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo dnf remove &lt;package_name&gt;</code></p>
<p>One may in install or remove a string of packages. Example:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo dnf --refresh install &lt;package_name_1&gt; &lt;package_name_2&gt; &lt;package_name_3&gt; &lt;package_name_4&gt;</code></p>
<p>More about package management with dnf <a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended update procedure</strong></p>
<p>While we do provide Discover and dnfdragora gui's for package mangement we find it best if users update their OM Lx 4.3/Rock system
from Konsole (or other terminal). This is very easy, just copy and paste this command:</p>
<p><code>$ dnf clean all ; sudo dnf clean all ; sudo dnf upgrade</code></p>
<p>Then press Enter key and when prompted enter your root (superuser) password. We recommend this because we see a lot of problem reports that
begin with "I updated my system with Discover updater" or "I updated my system with dnfdragora".
</p>
<p><strong>New Features and Major Changes</strong></p>
<p>In order to keep current with latest changes in Linux, computer security issues, and computer code writing there are major changes in
OMLx 4.3rc.</p>
