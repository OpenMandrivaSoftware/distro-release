OpenMandriva Lx

More in detail:
https://wiki.openmandriva.org/en/distribution/releases/current

Available Media

   This release is available as a live media DVD, downloadable in ISO
   format. These are available on our downloads page.

   Live media means you are able to run OpenMandriva Lx straight from a
   DVD or memory stick (see below) and try it before installing it. You
   may also install the system to hard disk either from the running live
   image or from the boot manager.

   Available ISO files are:

   1. KDE Plasma desktop x86_64 full featured (includes the most common
   used functionalities, multimedia and office software.)

   2. KDE Plasma desktop znver1 full featured (includes the most common
   used functionalities, multimedia and office software.)

   3. Basic GUI with minimal desktop and only basic system packages and a
   web browser.
   The concept is for user to then install only packages they wish to use
   after installing basic system. Also for users with less robust
   hardware.

Recommended Hardware

   OpenMandriva Lx requires at least 2.0 GB of memory and at least 10
   GB of hard drive space (see below for known issues with partitioning).

   Release is available for x86_64 and znver1 architectures, the 32-bit
   ARM, aarch64, and RISC-V architectures are being worked on, but are not
   yet available for this release.

   Important Note: Graphics Hardware

   The KDE Plasma Desktop requires a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL
   2.0 or above. We recommend using AMD, Intel, Adreno or VC4 graphics
   chips.

Virtual Machines

   At this time the only virtualization software that OMLx ISOs are tested
   on is VirtualBox. The same hardware requirements apply when running in
   virtual machines.

   For VirtualBox, however, you must always have at least 2048 MB of
   memory or OpenMandriva Lx will fail to boot.


Partitioning

   At this time partitioning LVM and Raid setups with Calamares (the
   installer) is NOT supported.

Installer and EFI Support

   This release of OpenMandriva Lx supports booting and installation with
   and without UEFI.

   Note that secure boot is NOT supported.


Booting from USB

It is also possible to boot this release from an USB storage device. To 
transfer the live/installation image you may use the ROSA Image Writer available from our repos
Warning: Please do not use other usb-writing tools as some Windows tools (e.g.
   Rufus) truncate the volume name. This breaks the boot process.

- Via dd

   You may alternatively dd the image to your USB stick:
dd if=<iso_name> of=<usb_drive> bs=4M

   Replace <iso_name> with the path to the ISO and <usb_drive> with the
   device node of the USB drive, i.e. /dev/sdb.

   SUSE Studio ImageWriter has also been tested and works for burning ISO
   images to USB storage device.

Upgrading from previous OpenMandriva Lx Releases

   Currently a fresh install is recommended.

   In order to keep current with latest changes in Linux, computer
   security issues, and computer code writing there are major changes in
   OM Lx4. A Fresh install is recommended.


Media Sources

     * main

   main is the core packages maintained by the OpenMandriva Lx team. This
   includes anything included in the install images as well as many more
   applications considered important.
   
     * unsupported

   unsupported represents community maintained packages. These are not
   supported by the core OpenMandriva Lx team, and depend on package
   maintainers to update it. There are many packages in unsupported that
   will not install and others that install but do not work properly.
   Users are welcome to use whatever they find in this repository that is
   working.
   
     * restricted

   restricted contains libraries that aren't installed by default due to
   legal concerns (such as patent issues). The usage of these packages
   vary by country - OpenMandriva Lx is not responsible for their usage!
   If you believe that their usage is disallowed in your country, please
   disable the restricted repositories.
   
     * non-free

   non-free contains applications and drivers that are distributable, but
   do not meet the definitions of Free Software. While we can adjust
   the packaging of such applications, we do not have the source code and
   therefore can not fix problems caused by anything in this repository.

Helping the Project

   The OpenMandriva development teams (Cooker & QA) are always looking for
   new contributors to assist in creating and maintaining packages and to
   assist bugfixing and testing. You are welcome to join us and help us in
   this work which is not only rewarding but also tremendous fun!

   If you feel that your talents do not lie in the realm of software, then
   the OpenMandriva Workshop group, which is made up from the artwork,
   documentation, translation and Communication teams, is always open for
   the submissions of artwork and translations. New contributors who would
   like to help with these wide-ranging tasks should see the wiki for more
   details, and to learn how to join! Alternatively you may use our Forum.

   It also costs time and money to keep our servers up and running. If you
   can, please donate to keep the lights on!
